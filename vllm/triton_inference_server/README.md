# Triton Inference Server

## Build Triton Inference Server 23.12 image with customised `MPTForCausalLM` class to support Sealion

```bash
cd sealion/vllm

docker build -f triton_inference_server/Dockerfile -t sealion-vllm-triton-server-image .
```

## Deploy Sealion model (e.g. sealion7b) with Triton Inference Server 23.12

Number of tensor parallel replicas (`tensor-parallel-size`) in `model_repository/sealion7b/1/model.json` can only be 1 (default) at the moment.

```bash
cd triton_inference_server

sudo docker run -u triton-server -d --gpus '"device=0"' --net=host --shm-size=1G --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
-v ${PWD}/model_repository:/opt/tritonserver/model_repository \
-v ~/.cache:/home/triton-server/.cache \
--name sealion_vllm_triton_server_container \
sealion-vllm-triton-server-image \
tritonserver --model-repository=model_repository
```
